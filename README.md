# ISSUES I AM AWARE OF
These are features I am aware dont work as intended and i am working on fixing them:
<br>
_Each new day does not clear the entrys from the last_
<br>
_Each new day still marks the current hour as present even thought the same hour on a different day is not present (same for past and future indicators)_
